# Write a function that takes in an array of numbers and returns the largest number.

# clarify
# input: [2, 5, 3, 88, 34, 1, 88] => array
# output: 88 => integer

# visualize (how do I do this?)
# find first number in the array & assign to a variable
# loop through the array and for each element, see if it's larger than the variable
# make variable whichever number is larger
# ouput final variable of largest number
